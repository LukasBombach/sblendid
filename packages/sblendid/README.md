# S*ble*ndid

## Basic Bluetooth knowledge

## Usage

Install `@sblendid/sblendid` and `@sblendid/adapter-node` with npm or yarn

```bash
npm install @sblendid/sblendid @sblendid/adapter-node
```

In the future, Sblendid should support multiple platforms including React Native and WebBluetooth.
Hence, there is a separate package for for using Sblendid with Node so you can swap adapters for
using it on another platform.

## API

Sblendid has 4 main classes

| Class            | Desciption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Sblendid`       | Lets you find and connect to peripherals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Peripheral`     | Lets you connect to peripherals and read its services and RSSI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `Service`        | Lets you read, write and subscribe to updates on values (characteristics) of a service as well as                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | fetching all available characteristics |
| `Characteristic` | A representation of a single characteristic of a service that lets you read, write and subscribe to updates of a specific value. Usually you will not need to use this class as everything you can do with this on a single characteristic, you can already do with the service class on all available characteristics |

### `Sblendid`

#### `static async powerOn(): Promise<Sblendid>`

Before you can use BLE on your machine you need to turn on
your BLE adapter. This static method will turn on the adapter
and return an instance of sblendid that you can then use to
find and connect to peripherals

```ts
import Sblendid from "@sblendid/sblendid";

const sblendid = await Sblendid.powerOn();
sblendid.startScanning();
```

#### `static async connect(condition: Condition): Promise<Peripheral>`

Often times you have a specific peripheral in mind you want to
connect to. You would usually

1. turn on your BLE adapter
1. start scanning
1. check each peripheral if it is what you are looking for
1. stop scanning
1. connect to the peripheral

There is a shortcut for that. You can call `Sblendid.connect` to do all that.
Pass either a peripheral name, uuid, address or callback function as an argument
and you will get a connected peripheral as return value once the peripheral has
been found.

The callback function will receive an instance of a `Peripheral` that represents any
peripheral found while scanning. The callback function can be sync or async
(i.e. return a Promise) and must always return aÃ³r resolve to a Boolean signaling
of the given peripheral is the one you were looking for. If true, `Sblendid.connect`
will stop scanning, connect to that peripheral and return it.

```ts
import Sblendid from "@sblendid/sblendid";

// By Name
const peripheral = await Sblendid.connect("My Peripheral");

// By UUID
const peripheral = await Sblendid.connect("3A62F159");

// By Address
const peripheral = await Sblendid.connect("00-14-22-01-23-45");

// With a callback
const peripheral = await Sblendid.connect(periperal =>
  Boolean(periperal.connectable)
);

// With an async callback
const peripheral = await Sblendid.connect(
  async periperal => await isPeripheralIAmLookingFor(periperal)
);
```

##### Timeouts

It is important to know that no function in this libary has a timeout. `Sblendid.connect`
will scan indefinitely unless you make sure it doesn't. At some point in the future
timeouts will be built in but it is not a scope of version 1.0.0
